You must build an express/mongo app that:

√ Has at least one one-many relationship

√ Must use referenced documents, not embedded documents

√ Must display both the "parent" and the "children" on the same page

√ Has at least one many-to-many relationship

√ Must use an array of ids in one of the collections

√ Must display the "parent" and the "children" on the same page

√ Has a complete and correct ERD diagram that describes your model

√ Can be a whiteboard drawing you took a picture of

√ Allows users to CRUD all of the models in the app

√ See UI patterns for suggestions

√ Server-side validations on all objects

√ simple required-field validations will work

√ use all promises (no callbacks allowed!)

- not have any references to Monk or Mongoose in your routes files

 - all db-related calls must be in files in your ./lib directory
